Element-Wise Multimodal Fusion for Object Detection
Simple yet effective fusion of RGB and Thermal modalities for object detection using element-wise addition at multiple pyramid scales.
This repository implements element-wise multimodal fusion for object detection, demonstrating that sophisticated fusion mechanisms aren't always necessary. Our approach achieves 87.1% mAP@0.5 using simple tensor addition between RGB and thermal feature maps.
